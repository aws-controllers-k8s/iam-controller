              LoginProfileSpec defines the desired state of LoginProfile.

              Contains the user name and password create date for a user.

              This data type is used as a response element in the CreateLoginProfile and
              GetLoginProfile operations.
            properties:
              name:
                description: |-
                  The name of the IAM user to create a password for. The user must already
                  exist.

                  This parameter is optional. If no user name is included, it defaults to the
                  principal making the request. When you make this request with root user credentials,
                  you must use an AssumeRoot (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoot.html)
                  session to omit the user name.

                  This parameter allows (through its regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex))
                  a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters
                  with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

                  Regex Pattern: `^[\w+=,.@-]+$`
                type: string
                x-kubernetes-validations:

              password:
                description: |-
                  The new password for the user.

                  This parameter must be omitted when you make the request with an AssumeRoot
                  (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoot.html)
                  session. It is required in all other cases.

                  The regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) that is used to validate
                  this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost
                  any printable ASCII character from the space (\u0020) through the end of
                  the ASCII character range (\u00FF). You can also include the tab (\u0009),
                  line feed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters. Any of these
                  characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Amazon
                  Web Services Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain
                  characters because they have special meaning within that tool.

                  Regex Pattern: `^[\u0009\u000A\u000D\u0020-\u00FF]+$`

                      once the controller has orchestrated the creation of the resource OR
                      when it has verified that an "adopted" resource (a resource where the
                      ARN annotation was set by the Kubernetes user on the CR) exists and
