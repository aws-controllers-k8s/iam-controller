                  An XML document generated by an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML
                  2.0. The document includes the issuer's name, expiration information, and
                  keys that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions)
                  that are received from the IdP. You must generate the metadata document using
                  the identity management software that is used as your organization's IdP.

                  A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM SAML provider. Each
                  tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information

                  If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number
                  of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.
